Ladies gonna fall, do you know?
Though I, though I
There is a place down the stairs
Follow on all time.
Droll the window, droll the window, droll the window
In your. wouldn't fall to.
In your. with a long way

Do you know.
Droll the window, droll the window, droll the window
Droll the window, droll the window, droll the window
Ladies gonna fall, do you know?
Though I, though I
There is a place down the stairs
You're going on city alone
